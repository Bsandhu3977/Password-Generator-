PASSWORD GENERATOR 

Overview: This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app can run in a browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code. It can also adapt to multiple screen sizes. 

Motivation: As an employee with access to sensitive data, I wanted to create an application that could randomly generate a password using certain criteria in hopes of creating a strong password that will thus provide greater security to company data. 

How does it work?
When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button it calls to a function whose first step will be to ask a series of prompts and booleans. The user will be asked how long they would like their password to be, if they would like special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters or numbers. 
Next the function will use conditionals to evaluate what type of characters to be allowed in the password according to user response. 
These responses will be stored in one array which will then output random elements to generate the random password. 

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS, Javascript
